# This project incorporates several functions associated with a provided expression as a string.
# findNextOpr returns the leftmost operator in a string.
# isNumber tells if a character is numeric.
# getNextNumber takes a string and a position in that string to determine the next number after that position.
# postfix turns an expression into a postfix expression.
